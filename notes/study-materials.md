### Rust Learning Resources

As I progress through learning Rust, here are two key resources I’ll reference to deepen my understanding:

---

#### 1. [The Rust Programming Language (The Rust Book)](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)

- **Overview**:
  - This is the official guide for learning Rust, written and maintained by the Rust team.
  - It covers the language’s syntax, ownership model, concurrency, and more.
  - The book includes plenty of examples and exercises to reinforce concepts.
- **Best For**:

  - Beginners who want a structured, in-depth introduction to Rust.
  - Intermediate developers who need a detailed reference guide.

- **How I’ll Use It**:
  - Follow step-by-step lessons to learn concepts.
  - Refer back to chapters as I encounter new challenges.

#### 2. [Brown University Rust Book](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/)

- **Overview**:

  - An interactive Rust guide designed by Brown University.
  - Includes quizzes and interactive exercises after each section to test understanding.
  - Provides immediate feedback, making it great for self-assessment.

- **Best For**:

  - Developers who prefer hands-on learning with quizzes to reinforce material.
  - Reviewing and testing knowledge of Rust concepts as I learn them.

- **How I’ll Use It**:
  - Use alongside exercises to ensure I understand the material.
  - Take quizzes to solidify knowledge before moving on to new topics.

### Study Plan

1. Start each topic with _The Rust Programming Language_ to gain foundational knowledge.
2. Use the Brown University Rust Book to reinforce learning with interactive quizzes.
3. Take notes on key concepts and examples as I progress.
4. Build projects and exercises from both books to practice applying what I’ve learned.

This combination of resources ensures a balance of theoretical understanding and practical application while keeping the learning process interactive and engaging.
